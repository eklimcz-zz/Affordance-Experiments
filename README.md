Alternative Input Examples
=========

Two small web applications that demonstrate alternative interaction concepts. Read the accompanying blog post for more contenxt here: 

Both experiments require a [makey makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) (or Arduino), a hardware button and switch. Alternatively, you can use your keyboard by pressing the Space bar and Down arrow keys. 

* **Particles** - uses processing and [makey makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) to demonstrate how to use a swtich and button to control a partical visualizaiton. 

* **Photobooth** - uses GetUserMedia() to access the web cam, Three.JS for the pixel shaders, TweenLite for animations, and makey makey to create a unique photobooth interaction. (Chrome only)
